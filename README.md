## Overview

Ashesi Kick-Off was developed to:

- Improve student engagement with campus sports activities.
- Provide a single source of truth for teams, players, statistics, and fixtures.
- Demonstrate core desktop application concepts in Java using Swing and AWT.

All data in this version is stored locally (CSV files). Networking and backend integrations were intentionally out of scope at the time of development.

## Architecture Highlights

- Modular separation between UI components and data models.
- Reusable panels for team, league, and player views.
- CSV-based data loaders for simple persistence during development.

---

## Known Limitations

- Not connected to the internet or any backend services.
- Data is static and must be updated manually.
- Limited responsiveness on window resize.
- Transfer request feature is UI-only.

---

## Roadmap / Future Improvements

- Replace CSV with a relational database.
- Introduce REST APIs for live data.
- Improve UI responsiveness and transitions.
- Add analytics and visualization (e.g., charts and dashboards).
- Redesign UI for accessibility and consistency.

---

## Running the Application

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Ensure Java (JDK 8+) is installed.
4. Run the main application class.

> Note: Ensure CSV files remain in the expected directory structure.
